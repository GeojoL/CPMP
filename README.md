电脑科学与音乐制作



I really want to use English as my default language, but I am not a native speaker.
In this project, I may talking a lot about my views. 
For making clear of my opinion, I rather to use my native language to describe it.
Anyone will be more than welcome if you'd like to help me to translate.

在描述个人观点的时候,为了避免误解,相对复杂的逻辑,我会用我的母语来表达.在描述客观事实和名词的时候,我会尽可能用英文.
